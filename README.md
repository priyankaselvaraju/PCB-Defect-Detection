**DEFECT DETECTION IN PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS USING IMAGE PROCESSING AND DEEP LEARNING**
The model targets six common defects: missing hole, mouse bite, open circuit, short circuit, spur, and spurious copper. The proposed model employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically learn 
discriminative features from PCB images, enabling effective defect classification. Graphical User Interface (GUI) is also developed to demonstrate the identification of defects in both bare and assembled PCB.
